The question under consideration is, what is the best area in London to open a new restaurant? On a related note, I will try to find the best place to open a cafe. The insights that I will obtain in the process can help future business owners to find promising spots for their planned establishment. Among other things, I will take into consideration the current distribution of cafes/restaurants in the various neighborhoods and (if possible) the population density."
